## Overview

This program fetches weather data for a specific city (in this case, Coral Gables) from the OpenWeatherMap API and then sends a weather alert via Twilio SMS. It provides essential weather information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and sunrise/sunset times.

## Functions

### `kelvin_to_celsius_and_fahrenheit(kelvin)`

This function converts temperature from Kelvin to Celsius and Fahrenheit.

### `wind_speed_conversion(wind_speed)`

This function converts wind speed from meters per second to miles per hour and kilometers per hour.

### `send_weather_alert(weather_info)`

This function sends a weather alert message using Twilio. It reads account SID, authentication token, and phone numbers from external files.

### `main()`

The `main()` function is the entry point of the program. It fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API, processes the data, and then sends the weather alert via Twilio using the `send_weather_alert()` function.

## Usage

To use this program effectively, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have the necessary API keys and credentials.
2. Customize the city by modifying the `CITY` variable in the script.
3. Prepare the required configuration files (`api_key.txt`, `account_sid.txt`, `auth_token.txt`, `twilio_phone_number.txt`, and `my_phone_number.txt`) with your specific values.
4. Run the script, and you will receive a weather alert SMS with the current weather conditions.

## Configuration

Before running the program, make sure to configure the following files with the appropriate values:

- `api_key.txt`: Your OpenWeatherMap API key.
- `account_sid.txt` and `auth_token.txt`: Twilio account SID and authentication token.
- `twilio_phone_number.txt`: Your Twilio phone number.
- `my_phone_number.txt`: The recipient phone number for the weather alert.

## Acknowledgments

This program makes use of the following libraries and APIs:

- [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/): For weather data retrieval.
- [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/): For sending SMS alerts.
